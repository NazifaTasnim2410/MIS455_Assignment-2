                <h1>Facts about South Korea</h1>
                <p>
                    *It's common in Korea to ask about blood types.-One of the interesting facts about blood types in South Korea is that they are thought to contribute to a person's personality and characteristics.
                     Blood types can be used to help choose a spouse since your partner's blood type may not be a good match for yours.<br>
                    *South Koreans are one year old when born.- A newborn baby is considered one year old in South Korea.
                     One explanation is that people think it's because the baby is in the mother's womb for nine months, which is about one year. Therefore in South Korea, the baby is one year old when born.<br>
                    *Koreans prefer titles over names.-Culture in South Korea is very hierarchical, and much of it based on age.
                    Only in specific situations are you allowed to call someone by their first name. Otherwise, you need to refer to them by title. <br>
                    *Food delivery is taken VERY seriously.-One of the unique facts about South Korean food delivery is that once you've finished enjoying your meal, you can put the dishes outside of your front door, and the person who delivered your food will swing back later to pick them up. Now that's what we call fantastic service!<br>
                    *Samsung is everywhere.-Samsung is one of the largest technology countries globally, and it's based in Seoul — the company is responsible for a fifth of the country's booming economy, which is no small feat!<br>
                    *Both men and women are obsessed with makeup.-There is no stigma about men wearing makeup, so some men wear significantly more makeup than women here! Everybody wants to put their best face forward, and makeup plays a big part in that.<br>
                    *Plastic surgery is SUPER normal.-While plastic surgery is taboo at best and frowned upon at worst in most Western countries, South Korea has fully embraced plastic surgery to the point that it is very accepted (and even encouraged).<br>
                    *Urban and natural beauty coexist.-Whether you're a city lover or a fan of adventuring around the outdoors, South Korea truly has something for everybody! While there’s no arguing that Seoul is a fantastic city full of culture, shopping, and food, making it a huge tourist destination, South Korea is also full of great day hikes.

                        *There are two official languages in Canada.-Britain wasn't the only power-hungry colonial power at the time of Canada's pioneering days. There was also France, who once owned much of North America for a while.
